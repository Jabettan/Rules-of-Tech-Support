# Mantras

### OM1 - Mentat Mantra (Dune modified)  
It is by caffeine alone I set my mind in motion.  
It is by the beans of Java the thoughts acquire speed.  
The hands acquire shaking.  
The shaking becomes a warning.  
It is by caffeine alone I set my mind in motion.

#### OM2 - We the Willing mantra

We the willing, led by the unknowing  
Did the impossible for the ungrateful  
We have done so much for so long with so little  
That we can now do anything with nothing.
