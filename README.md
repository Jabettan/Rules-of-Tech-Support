## The sections are: 

## Credits
I have tried to give credit as best as I could. A number of these are from three or four years ago and I didn't think to keep track most of the time. I managed to find many of the contributors and their contributions using Google and Bing. However, some of the Rules kept the essence of a contribution but the wording changed so are not searchable. If you are certain that you inspired a Rule, let me know.
***
## Users
The main section.  Rules that cannot fit elsewhere are put here.

## Users Will...

Rules that have "users will" in them.

## Tech Only 

Rules about dealing with other techs. Some of it can be put in the main list of Rules, or from there to here, but would make that list a lot longer.
***
## Management

Rules about dealing with manglement.
***
## Phrases 
Questions and statements by tech support. Not to be shared with users.
***
## Mantras
A tech version of meditations. Ommm...
